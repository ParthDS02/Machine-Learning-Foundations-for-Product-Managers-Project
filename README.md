# Machine-Learning-Foundations-for-Product-Managers-Project
Machine learning project predicting the energy output of a power plant using environmental data (temperature, pressure, humidity, vacuum). Linear Regression and Random Forest models were compared, with Random Forest achieving better accuracy. Key steps include data exploration, model building, cross-validation, and performance evaluation.
